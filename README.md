#Project Name
Drug Inventory Management App

#Description
This project will create a Drug Inventory App. The Drug Inventory Management App is designed to provide an efficient solution for tracking and managing drug inventories across multiple pharmacies. With this app, pharmacy owners and administrators can easily monitor and update the availability of various drugs in their inventory. The app allows users to add new drugs, update existing drug information such as name, dose, formulation, and quantity, and delete drugs when necessary.

This is the backend, which will serve as the server to the frontend. There are two controllers in this app, a pharmacies controller and a drugs controller. The pharmacy has many drugs and the drug belongs to a pharmacy. Full CRUD capability is implemented, and users can make get, posts, patches, and delete requests.
